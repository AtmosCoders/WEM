PyWRFPlus
=========

PyWRFPlus is an amalgamation of numerous Python packages and scripts, with
some new ideas, with the goal of using Python to pre-process (WPS and WRF to
create data) and post-process (move, organise, plot, compute data). 

Where do I start?
=================

/bin/casestudyexample.py is an example script that shows the plots that can be
created. The other essential file you will need to personalise is
/bin/settings.py. The class therein contains all the settings for plotting.
All settings can be left as default (by not specifying a setting), but details
like path to WRF data, path to output figures, etc, are essential.
