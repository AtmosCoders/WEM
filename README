The lazyWRF project aims to simplify the WPS/WRF process for a few reasons:
  (1) It makes life easier 
  (2) It reduces silly mistakes that overwrite old output files (notwithstanding bugs in this code!)
  (3) It can maximise efficiency when submitting jobs to a server (i.e. it can do it overnight)
  
This is a work in progress, and comments as highly encouraged. The final goal is a portable and bug-free collection of standalone code that anyone can download, assuming basic Python package installs.

Please report suggestions, issues, etc to me via GitHub and I will improve and fix the package as we go along. Hopefully there is something useful to come out of this, potentially to be presented at the American Meteorological Society Annual Meeting 2014 in Atlanta, Georgia.
